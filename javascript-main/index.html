            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.
                </li>
                <li>
                    2. Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Hello world</h2>
            <p>
                To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first <code>"Hello world"</code> JavaScript code:
            </p>
            <code class="group">
                function greetMe(yourName) { <br/> alert("Hello " + yourName); <br/> } <br />
                greetMe("World");
            </code>
            <p>
                Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser!
            </p>

            <h2>Variables</h2>
            <p>
                You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.
            </p>
            <p>
                A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).
            </p>
            <p>
                You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and _name.
            </p>
            <h2>Declaring variables</h2>
            <p>You can declare a variable in three ways:</p>
            <p>With the keyword var. For example,</p>
            <code>
                var x = 42
            </code>
            <p>
                This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this variant.
            </p>
            <p>
                With the keyword let. For example,
            </p>
            <code>
                let y = 13
            </code>
            <p>This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See Variable scope below.</p>
            <h2>Variable scope</h2>
            <p>
                When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because it is available to any other code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is called a local variable, because it is available only within that function.
            </p>
            <p>
                JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope; rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the function (or global scope) that the block resides within. For example the following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function (or global context) within which x is declared, not the block, which in this case is an if statement.
            </p>
            <code>
                if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5
            </code>
            <p>
                This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in ECMAScript 2015.
            </p>
            <code>
                if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not defined
            </code>
            <h2>Loops and Iteration</h2>
            <p>The statements for loops provided in JavaScript are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>for statement</li>
                <li>do...while statement</li>
                <li>while statement</li>
                <li>break statement</li>
                <li>continue statement</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You can think of a loop as a computerized version of the game where you tell someone to take X steps in one direction then Y steps in another; for example, the idea "Go five steps to the east" could be expressed this way as a loop:</p>
            <code>
                var step; 
                for (step = 0; step < 5; step++) {
                    // Runs 5 times, with values of step 0 through 4.
                    console.log('Walking east one step');
                }
                If...else statement
            </code>
            <p>
                Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is true. Use the optional else clause to execute a statement if the condition is false. An if statement looks as follows:
            </p>
            <code>
                if (condition) { statement_1; } else { statement_2; } 
            </code>
            <p>
                condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. See Boolean for an explanation of what evaluates to true and false. If condition evaluates to true, statement_1 is executed; otherwise, statement_2 is executed. statement_1 and statement_2 can be any statement, including further nested if statements.
            </p>
            <p>
                You may also compound the statements using else if to have multiple conditions tested in sequence, as follows:
            </p>
            <code>
                if (condition_1) { statement_1; } else if (condition_2) { statement_2;
                } else if (condition_n) { statement_n; } else { statement_last; }                
            </code>
            <p>
                In the case of multiple conditions only the first logical condition which evaluates to true will be executed. To execute multiple statements, group them within a block statement ({ ... }) . In general, it's good practice to always use block statements, especially when nesting if statements:
            </p>
            <code>
                if (condition) { statement_1_runs_if_condition_is_true;
                    statement_2_runs_if_condition_is_true; } else {
                    statement_3_runs_if_condition_is_false;
                    statement_4_runs_if_condition_is_false; 
                }                    
            </code>
            <p>
                It is advisable to not use simple assignments in a conditional expression, because the assignment can be confused with equality when glancing over the code. For example, do not use the following code:
            </p>
            <code>
                if (x = y) { /* statements here */ }
            </code>
            <p>
                If you need to use an assignment in a conditional expression, a common practice is to put additional parentheses around the assignment. For example:
            </p>
            <code>
                if ((x = y)) { /* statements here */ }
            </code>
            <h2>While statement</h2>
            <p>
                A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows:
            </p>
            <code>
                while (condition) statement
            </code>
            <p>
                If the condition becomes false, statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to the statement following the loop.
            </p>
            <p>
                The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed. If the condition returns true, statement is executed and the condition is tested again. If the condition returns false, execution stops and control is passed to the statement following while.
                To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ ... }) to group those statements.
            </p>
            <p>
                Example:
            </p>
            <p>
                The following while loop iterates as long as n is less than three:
            </p>
            <code>
                var n = 0; var x = 0; while (n < 3) { n++; x += n; }
            </code>
            <p>
                With each iteration, the loop increments n and adds that value to x. Therefore, x and n take on the following values:
            </p>
            <p>
                After the first pass: n = 1 and x = 1
                After the second pass: n = 2 and x = 3
                After the third pass: n = 3 and x = 6
            </p>
            <p>
                After completing the third pass, the condition n < 3 is no longer true, so the loop terminates.
            </p>
            <h2>Function declarations</h2>
            <p>
                A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:
            </p>
            <p>
                The name of the function.
                A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.
                The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, { }.
            </p>
            <p>For example, the following code defines a simple function named square:</p>
            <code>
                function square(number) { return number * number; }
            </code>
            <p>
                The function square takes one argument, called number. The function consists of one statement that says to return the argument of the function (that is, number) multiplied by itself. The return statement specifies the value returned by the function.
            </p>
            <code>
                return number * number;
            </code>
            <p>
                Primitive parameters (such as a number) are passed to functions by value; the value is passed to the function, but if the function changes the value of the parameter, this change is not reflected globally or in the calling function.
            </p>
            <h2>Functions</h2>
            <p>
                In JavaScript functions are just values, they can be assigned to variables, passed to or returned from functions. A function iis invoked by adding '()' after it. You can also pass values to the function inside those parentheses.
            </p>
            <code>
                function hello(name) {
                     return `Hello ${name}`
                }
                    hello('Nova'); // -> Hello Nova                    
            </code>
            <h2>Higher-order functions</h2>
            <p>
                Higher-order functions are just functions that either accept other functions as arguments or that return functions.
            </p>
            <code>
                function test(value, action) {
                      return action(value)
                }
                    test(5, console.log); // -> 5                    
            </code>
            <h2>
                Closures
            </h2>
            <p>A closure is one of two things:</p>
            <ol>
                <li> A feature whereby the inner scope has access to the outer scope</li>
                <li>A function's ability to always have access to the context in which it was created.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                Let me demonstrate:
            </p>
            <code>
                /* Here the inner function has access to the argument 'a' of the outer function */
                function combine(a) {
                   return function(b) {
                       return a + b
                   }
                }
                let add5 = combine(5) /* this is a closure, we have a function that has access to the context in which it was created */
                add5(3) // -> 8
            </code>
            <h2>Objects</h2>
            <p>
                JavaScript is designed on a simple object-based paradigm. An object is a collection of properties, and a property is an association between a name (or key) and a value. A property's value can be a function, in which case the property is known as a method. In addition to objects that are predefined in the browser, you can define your own objects. This chapter describes how to use objects, properties, functions, and methods, and how to create your own objects.
            </p>
            <p>
                Objects in JavaScript, just as in many other programming languages, can be compared to objects in real life. The concept of objects in JavaScript can be understood with real life, tangible objects. In JavaScript, an object is a standalone entity, with properties and type. Compare it with a cup, for example. A cup is an object, with properties. A cup has a color, a design, weight, a material it is made of, etc. The same way, JavaScript objects can have properties, which define their characteristics.
            </p>
            <code>
                var myCar = new Object();
                myCar.make = 'Ford';
                myCar.model = 'Mustang';
                myCar.year = 1969;
            </code>
            <h2>Objects</h2>
            <p>
                The 2 most common objects in JavaScript are the array and the object. An array is a sequenced storage of values, whereas an object is a key-value storage of values.
            </p>
            <code>
                let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]
                arr[0]; /* -> 1 , this is called bracket notation and is used to access the first element in an array */

                let obj = {name: 'Ryan'}
                obj.name /* -> Ryan , this is called dot notation and is used to access an object's property. */

            </code>
            <p>
                Bracket notation evaluates the provided value(s), converts them to a string and tries to access a property with that key. Because dot notation works only on strings that are proper variable names (no spaces, can't start with a number...), we have to use bracket notation to get an element from an array. Though we can't use dot notation for arrays, it's perfectly fine to use bracket notation for objects.
            </p>
            <h2>Prototypes</h2>
            <p>
                A prototype is just an object that acts as a fallback source of properties. Almost everything in JavaScript has an object. When a you try to access a property that an object doesn't have, its prototype is searched for that property, and then its prototype's prototype and so on. I'll build on top of the previous example in order to not repeat myself.
            </p>
            <code>
                Gamer.prototype.name = 'unknown';
                aurora.name // -> unknown
            </code>
            <p>In the above code the following happens:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>the aurora object gets searched for the name property, but no such property is found on the object</li>
                <li>then its prototype gets searched and the property is found there (the prototype of aurora is the prototype property of the constructor function, through which aurora was defined. In this case - Gamer).</li>
            </ol>
            <h2>Constructors and classes</h2>
            <p>
                A constructor is just a streamlined way to create an object with a specific structure. A constructor has 2 jobs:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Make sure the object has the needed own properties (properties found on the object itself, i.e. not on the prototype)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Make sure the object derives from the correct prototype.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                The prototype of instances created through the constructor is by default the constructor property of the constructor function itself. Note, the prototype property is different to the prototype of something. A class is just syntactic sugar on top of a constructor function. The downside is that classes currently support only methods (that is only properties that hold function values). Instances (objects created through constructor functions) are created by adding the keyword new before calling a constructor function.
            </p>
            <code>
                constructor Human(name) {
                     this.name = name;
                    }

            <h2>Inheritance</h2>
            <p>
                Inheritance is when functionality is passed from parent (supertype) to child (subtype).
            </p>
            <code>
                class Human {
                     constructor(name) {
                      this.name = name
                     }
                    }
                    
                    class Gamer extends Human {
                     constructor(name, game) {
                      super(name)
                      this.game = game
                     }
                    }
                    
                    let gamer = new Gamer('STPeach', 'Overwatch')
                    gamer // -> {name: 'STPeach', game: 'Overwatch'}
                    
                    /* Currently our gamer has 2 own properties, notice how we called super(name) earlier, this called the constructor function of the parent with the name argument provided. */
                    
                    /* Now lets have some fun with the prototypes */
                    Human.prototype.species = 'Homo Sapiens'
                    Gamer.prototype.social = false
                    
                    gamer.species // -> Homo Sapiens
                    gamer.social // -> false                    
            </code>
            <p>
                The above are examples of inheritance and the prototype chain (a chain of objects that act as fallback property providers).
                To check the prototype property of your constructor functions (classes), you can use either dot or bracket notation):
            </p>
            <code>
                Human.prototype // -> { species: 'Homo Sapiens', ... }
                Gamer['prototype'] // -> { social: false, ... }
            </code>
            <p>
                To get the prototype of something, use Object.getPrototypeOf(something)
            </p>
            <code>
                Object.getPrototypeOf(Gamer) // -> function Human() 
                /* the above returns the constructor function of the prototype, instead of the whole prototype as an object */
                // So the following is true
               Object.getPrototypeOf(Gamer) == Human.prototype.constructor // -> true
            </code>
            <h2>Regular Expressions</h2>
            <p>
                Regular expressions are patterns used to match character combinations in strings. In JavaScript, regular expressions are also objects. These patterns are used with the exec and test methods of RegExp, and with the match, replace, search, and split methods of String. This chapter describes JavaScript regular expressions.
